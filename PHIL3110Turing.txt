; This program accepts a block of n-many 1’s and outputs a block of 2n-many 1’s, 
; after the original block with a single blank space separating them; 

; Henceforth:
; - the n-many 1's will be referred to as the "parameter array"
; - the 2n-many 1's will be referred to as the "accumulator array"
; - the single blank space seperating them will be referred to as "the divider"

; ALGORITHM SUMMARY: Move a loop pointer through the parameter array, 
; terminating the loop when the pointer reaches the end of the parameter array. 
; On each loop, append two 1s to the end of the accumulator array.

; ### State 0: as per the assignment sheet, the head should start under the 1th cell
; Furthermore, this instruction moves the head into the correct position for 
; initializing our loop pointer
0	- 	-	R	s1

; ### State 1 deals with placing our loop pointer
; Our loop pointer is a blank, that shifts through our parameter array.
; where [_ 1 1 1] starts the loop, and [1 1 1 1] halts the loop

; This instruction puts down the new loop pointer.
; This either initializes it (if we came from State 0), 
; or increments it (if we came from State 6)
s1	1	-	R	s2

; ### State 2 deals with getting to the start of the accumulator array
; Glide over the parameter array
s2	1	1	R	s2

; Jump over the divider
s2	-	-	R	s3
 
; ### State 4 and 5 deal with getting to the end of the accumulator, 
; and appending two 1s.
; Glide over the accumulator...
s3	1	1	R	s3

; ... until we pop out the end of the accumulator. Put down a 1...
s3	-	1	R	s4

; ... and another one. Now we've gotta turn back around and increment the loop variable.
s4	-	1	L	s5

; ### State 5 deals with trying to get back to the end of the parameter array
; Glide back over the accumulator array
s5	1	1	L	s5
; Jump over the divider
s5	-	-	L	s6

; ### State 6 deals with incrementing our loop variable
; Glide over our parameter array... 
s6	1	1	L	s6

; ...until we hit our loop pointer. We clear the current loop pointer, shift the
; head right, and loop back to state 0, so that it may deal with the next loop iteration
